# Rust Communities Map 🌍🦀
This project was inspired by **[Yasunori Kirimoto](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yasunori-kirimoto/)'s AWS Heroes Map**, which beautifully visualizes AWS Heroes around the world. Similarly, I wanted to create a **Rust Communities Map** to help Rustaceans find and connect with local meetups.

## 🌍 Find and Join a Rust Community Nearby! 🦀  

I've been searching for **Rust communities** that are **active or have been active**, combining information from:  

- [Archived Rust Foundation Rust User Groups List](https://prev.rust-lang.org/en-US/user-groups.html)  
- [Rust Code Maven User Groups](https://rust.code-maven.com/user-groups)  

💡 **Don't see your meetup or community?** Open a **Pull Request (PR)** and contribute!

If you find a **community that hasn't had an event in a long time**, I encourage you to:  

📌 **Reach out to the organizer** – They might just need a little encouragement to restart events.  
📌 **Get things moving!** Suggest a meetup, connect with local Rustaceans, or offer to help organize.  
📌 **Submit a CFP (Call for Proposals)!** If you have experience with Rust, consider giving a talk and inspiring others to get involved.  

🛠️ **Apologies for the basic JavaScript** I plan to find time to **rewrite it in Rust** sometime soon
